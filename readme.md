# 🛰 Satellite Image Classification  using YOLOv11

This project focuses on *satellite image classification * using a custom YOLOv11 model. The dataset is preprocessed and labeled using *Label Studio*.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Classify different land types from satellite images.
- Detect boundaries of classified regions for precise mapping.
- Enhance accuracy using fine-tuned YOLOv8 models.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **YOLOv8**: Used for image classification and boundary detection.
- **OpenCV & NumPy**: For image processing and data manipulation.

---

## ⚡ Features

- *Satellite Image Change Detection:* Detect temporal changes in multispectral satellite images.
- *Custom YOLOv11 Model:* Fine-tuned with transfer learning and trained on multispectral data.
- *Prediction Pipeline:* Automated predictions with sample outputs stored in the /predict folder.
- *Label Studio Integration:* Dataset labeling and annotation using Label Studio.
